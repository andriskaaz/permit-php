# # ResourceInstanceBlockRead

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**key** | **string** | A unique identifier by which Permit will identify the resource instance for permission checks. You will later pass this identifier to the &#x60;permit.check()&#x60; API. A key can be anything: for example the resource db id, a url slug, a UUID or anything else as long as it&#39;s unique on your end. The resource instance key must be url-friendly. |
**tenant** | **string** | the *key* of the tenant that this resource belongs to, used to enforce tenant boundaries in multi-tenant apps. |
**resource** | **string** | the *key* of the resource (type) of this resource instance. For example: if this resource instance is the annual budget document, the key of the resource might be &#x60;document&#x60;. |
**attributes** | **object** | Arbitrary resource attributes that will be used to enforce attribute-based access control policies. | [optional]
